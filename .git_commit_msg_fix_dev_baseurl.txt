fix(blazor): restore localhost BaseUrl for development environment

Fix Blazor client failing to load in development:

Problem:
- appsettings.json had placeholder {BLAZOR_API_URL}
- appsettings.Development.json was empty
- Client couldn't connect to API (invalid URI error)
- App not loading in development

Solution:
- Set BaseUrl to https://localhost:44350 in both files
- Development.json takes precedence in dev environment
- Staging/Production still use their specific URLs

Configuration hierarchy:
- Development: localhost:44350 (local API)
- Staging: Railway URL (from appsettings.Staging.json)
- Production: Production URL (from appsettings.Production.json)

This ensures development works with localhost while
staging and production use their respective URLs.

Fixes: Local development broken by Railway CORS fix
