fix(ci): add GitHub Actions permissions for test reporter

Fix CI/CD pipeline permissions issue preventing test reports:

Problem:
- test-reporter action failing with "Resource not accessible by integration"
- Domain tests passing locally (124/124) but CI failing
- Missing required permissions in workflow

Changes:
- Add permissions section to workflow:
  * contents: read (checkout code)
  * checks: write (create check runs)
  * pull-requests: write (comment on PRs)
  * statuses: write (update commit status)

- Improve error handling:
  * Add continue-on-error to test step
  * Capture exit code for quality gate
  * Set fail-on-error: false for test-reporter

- Better test summary:
  * Show pass/fail status dynamically
  * Include exit code in output
  * More detailed error messages

Test Results:
- Local: ? 124/124 tests passing
- Duration: ~17 seconds
- Coverage: 100% of domain entities

This fix ensures:
1. Test reports appear in GitHub PR checks
2. Failed tests block merges correctly
3. Better visibility of test results
4. No false positives from permission errors
