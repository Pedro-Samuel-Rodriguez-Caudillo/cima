fix(blazor): add localization configuration to resolve translation errors

Fix localization error in Blazor WebAssembly client:

Problem:
- RegisterClientLocalizationsError: Cannot read properties of undefined
- main.js failing to load translations
- Design/UI broken due to missing localization setup

Solution:
- Add ConfigureLocalization() method to cimaBlazorClientModule
- Configure cimaResource with proper base types
- Add supported languages (Spanish and English)
- Clear and re-add language options

Changes:
- Added using statements for Localization and cimaResource
- Configured AbpLocalizationOptions with cimaResource
- Set Spanish (es) and English (en) as supported languages

This resolves the JavaScript error and ensures proper
localization initialization in the WebAssembly client.

Fixes: Translation errors breaking UI in development
