fix(css): unify Tailwind CSS build process and fix bundle paths

Fix CSS loading issues by unifying the Tailwind build process:

Changes:
- Update package.json to use main.css as Tailwind input
- Update app.css to import from main.css
- Fix CSS paths in App.razor to use _content path
- Update cimaStyleBundleContributor with correct bundle path
- Add CSS references to StyleBundles in cimaBlazorModule
- Rebuild app.min.css with new configuration

This fixes:
- CSS not loading in development
- Broken styles in production
- Tailwind utilities not being applied

All CSS now properly compiled from main.css to app.min.css
and served through correct _content/cima.Blazor.Client path.

Fixes: CSS loading and Tailwind compilation issues
