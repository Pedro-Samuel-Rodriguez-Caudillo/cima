  * Writing new tests (examples and templates)
  * Debugging tests
  * Common issues and solutions

- DIA_12_TESTING_COMPLETADO.md: Day 12 completion summary

- Code examples and templates
- CI/CD integration instructions
- Performance testing guidelines
- Troubleshooting common issues

Testing Philosophy:
- Test-driven development (TDD) encouraged
- Write tests for critical paths first
- Maintain high coverage for domain logic
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for production readiness

Files added:

Next steps:
1. Share docs with development team
2. Set up automated test runs in CI
3. Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
4. Review and update quarterly
