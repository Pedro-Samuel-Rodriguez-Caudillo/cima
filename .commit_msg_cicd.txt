Updated and created GitHub Actions workflows:

CI Build and Test:
- Added environment variables for .NET 9 and Node 20
- Improved logging and step organization
- Execute 124 Domain tests as quality gate
- Build Tailwind CSS automatically
- Code quality job with dotnet format check
- Upload artifacts for tests and publish

Domain Tests Workflow:
- Dedicated workflow for Domain tests
- Cache NuGet packages for speed
- Test reporter integration
- Code coverage with OpenCover
- Visual test summary in GitHub UI
- Quality gate enforcement
- Blocks merge if tests fail

Staging Deploy:
- Quality gate: tests must pass before deploy
- Run 124 Domain tests before deployment
- Create deployment summary with test status
- Deploy to Railway only if tests pass
- Improved notification and next steps

Features:
- 124 Domain tests execute automatically
- Quality gates block merge/deploy if tests fail
- Test results and coverage uploaded
- Visual summaries in GitHub
- Optimized with caching

Benefits:
- Code quality guaranteed
- Only tested code can merge
- Automatic deployment with validation
- Full visibility of code status
