fix(railway): configure CORS and BaseURL for staging environment

Fix CORS error preventing app from loading in Railway staging:

Problem:
- Blazor client trying to connect to localhost:44350 from Railway
- CORS blocking cross-origin requests
- No environment-specific configuration files

Solution:
1. Environment-specific appsettings for client:
   - appsettings.json: Base with variable placeholder
   - appsettings.Development.json: localhost:44350
   - appsettings.Staging.json: Railway URL (NEW)
   - appsettings.Production.json: Production URL (NEW)

2. Server configuration for Staging:
   - appsettings.Staging.json with Railway URLs (NEW)
   - CORS origins: https://cima-staging.up.railway.app
   - AuthServer authority: https://cima-staging.up.railway.app
   - SelfUrl: https://cima-staging.up.railway.app

Configuration Hierarchy:
- appsettings.json (base)
- appsettings.{Environment}.json (override by ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT)
- Environment variables (final override)

Railway automatically uses:
- ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging (already set)
- Loads appsettings.Staging.json
- Same-origin requests (no CORS issues)

Files created:
- src/cima.Blazor.Client/wwwroot/appsettings.Staging.json
- src/cima.Blazor.Client/wwwroot/appsettings.Production.json
- src/cima.Blazor/appsettings.Staging.json
- FIX_RAILWAY_CORS_BASEURL.md (documentation)

Files modified:
- src/cima.Blazor.Client/wwwroot/appsettings.json (use placeholder)

Expected result:
- No CORS errors in Railway
- Client calls same domain (https://cima-staging.up.railway.app)
- AuthServer properly configured
- App loads correctly

Railway will auto-deploy on push.
